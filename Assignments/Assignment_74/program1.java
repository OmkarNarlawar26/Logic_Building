/*

In your college library, students borrow books for exams and assignments.
The librarian wants an automatic fine calculator so that staff don’t need to calculate fines manually for every
student.

As per policy, a student can keep a borrowed book for up to 7 days without any penalty.

If the book is returned late, the fine depends on how many days the student kept the book in total.

Fine Rules:
    • If the book is returned within 7 days → No fine
    • If total days are 8 to 12 → ₹5 per day for each day beyond 7
    • If total days are more than 12 →
        ◦ ₹5 per day for days 8–12
        ◦ ₹10 per day for each day beyond 12

Input:
    • One integer: total number of days the book was kept (daysKept)

Validations:
    • If daysKept < 0 → invalid input

Expected Output:
    • If daysKept <= 7: Returned on time. No fine applicable.
    • Else: Total fine to be paid: ₹<fineAmount>
